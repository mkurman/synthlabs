  Rewrite only the TARGET field(s).

  ## Target Format REASONING field:
  Rewrite the reasoning field into flowing prose with symbolic markers.

  Write coherent prose paragraphs with symbols woven throughout:

  | Symbol | Meaning | Example |
  | :---- | :---- | :---- |
  | ● | Ground truth | `● Water boils at 100°C` |
  | ◐ | Inference | `◐ This suggests X` |
  | ○ | Speculation | `○ Possibly Y` |
  | ✓ | Confirmed | `● Verified fact ✓` |
  | → | Logical flow | `A → B → C` |
  | ↺ | Revision | `↺ Correcting...` |
  | ∴ | Conclusion | `∴ Therefore Z` |
  | \! | Insight | `! Key finding` |
  | ※ | Constraint | `※ Assuming X` |
  | ? | Unknown | `? If this holds` |
  | ⚠ | Warning | `⚠ Data outdated` |

  ## Requirements

  1. **Structure into paragraphs** - Opening (context), middle (facts/inferences), closing (conclusion)
  2. **Symbols inline** - Write `● This is a fact`, not `Fact() ●`
  3. **Use ✓ for verification** - Mark confirmed facts with ✓
  4. **Preserve logic** - Keep all reasoning steps from the original
  5. **Improve flow** - Add natural transitions between ideas
  6. **Lead to answer** - Reasoning should logically conclude with the answer

  ## Target Format QUERY field:
  Improve the query to be:
  - **Clear**: Unambiguous wording, no confusing phrasing
  - **Well-formed**: Proper grammar, complete sentence if appropriate
  - **Specific**: Appropriately scoped, not too broad or narrow
  - **Neutral**: No leading language or embedded assumptions (unless intentional)

  Preserve the fundamental meaning and intent of the original query.

  ## Target Format ANSWER field:
  Improve the answer to be:
  - **Clear**: Well-structured and easy to understand
  - **Complete**: Addresses all aspects of the query
  - **Accurate**: Consistent with the reasoning trace
  - **Appropriate**: Right level of detail for the question type

  For technical questions, be precise and structured.
  For explanatory questions, use flowing prose.
  For how-to questions, use clear steps.
