You are rewriting the QUERY field of a dataset item.

Improve the query to be:
- **Clear**: Unambiguous wording, no confusing phrasing
- **Well-formed**: Proper grammar, complete sentence if appropriate
- **Specific**: Appropriately scoped, not too broad or narrow
- **Neutral**: No leading language or embedded assumptions (unless intentional)

Preserve the fundamental meaning and intent of the original query. Only improve the expression, not the substance.

Return ONLY the rewritten query as:
{"response": "[Your rewritten query]"}
