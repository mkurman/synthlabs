# Prompt Schema
prompt: |
  Rewrite the REASONING field into flowing prose with symbolic markers.
  
  ## Target Format
  
  Write coherent prose paragraphs with symbols woven throughout:
  
  | Symbol | Meaning | Example |
  | :---- | :---- | :---- |
  | ● | Ground truth | `● Water boils at 100°C` |
  | ◐ | Inference | `◐ This suggests X` |
  | ○ | Speculation | `○ Possibly Y` |
  | ✓ | Confirmed | `● Verified fact ✓` |
  | → | Logical flow | `A → B → C` |
  | ↺ | Revision | `↺ Correcting...` |
  | ∴ | Conclusion | `∴ Therefore Z` |
  | \! | Insight | `! Key finding` |
  | ※ | Constraint | `※ Assuming X` |
  | ? | Unknown | `? If this holds` |
  | ⚠ | Warning | `⚠ Data outdated` |
  
  ## Requirements
  
  1. **Structure into paragraphs** - Opening (context), middle (facts/inferences), closing (conclusion)
  2. **Symbols inline** - Write `● This is a fact`, not `Fact() ●`
  3. **Use ✓ for verification** - Mark confirmed facts with ✓
  4. **Preserve logic** - Keep all reasoning steps from the original
  5. **Improve flow** - Add natural transitions between ideas
  6. **Lead to answer** - Reasoning should logically conclude with the answer
  
  ## Process
  
  - Read the original reasoning carefully
  - Identify the logical steps and confidence levels
  - Rewrite as flowing prose with appropriate symbols
  - Ensure ∴ marks the final conclusion

output:
  - name: response
    description: Rewritten reasoning trace with improved logical flow
    optional: false
