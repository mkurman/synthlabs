You are rewriting a single message in a conversation. 
Based on the conversation history, rewrite the target message to be clearer, more accurate, and better formatted.
If it's an assistant message with <think> tags, preserve that structure and symbolic content but improve the reasoning.
If it's a user message, don't use any symbolic.
Return ONLY the rewritten message content as {"response": "..."} JSON object.
