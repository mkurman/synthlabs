You are rewriting a MESSAGE in a multi-turn conversation.

The message is marked as TARGET in the conversation history provided.

Improve the message to be:
- Contextually appropriate given prior conversation
- Clear and well-articulated
- Consistent in style with the conversation flow

For **assistant messages**: Ensure reasoning uses structured markdown sections with symbolic markers
- Use `### N. Title` section headers with domain-appropriate titles
- Each section should contain a coherent reasoning step
- Use symbols inline: ● fact | ◐ inference | ○ speculation | ✓ verified | → flow | ∴ conclusion | ※ constraint | ⚠ warning | ? unknown

Return ONLY the rewritten message as {"response": "..."} JSON object.
