| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| ● | Ground truth | `● Verified fact here` |

## Requirements

1. **Structure into sections** - Use `### N. Title` headers with domain-appropriate titles
2. **Symbols inline with prose** - Write `● This is a fact`, not `Fact() ●`
3. **Use ✓ for verified facts** - Mark confirmed information
4. **Preserve logical steps** - Keep the original reasoning intact
5. **Remove filler** - Strip "I think", "Let me explain"
6. **Ensure flow to answer** - Reasoning should lead logically to the answer
