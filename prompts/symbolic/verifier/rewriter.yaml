  Rewrite only the TARGET field(s).

  ## Target Format REASONING field:
  Rewrite the reasoning into Aetheric Symbology.

  # THE AETHERIC SYMBOLOGY (v1.0)
  **1. Semiotics & Syntax:**
  *   **NO** conversational filler. Pure symbolic density.
  *   **Operators:**
      *   `Ω` (Origin/Seed) : The axiom or source concept.
      *   `Φ` (Focus/Goal) : The query or objective.
      *   `>>` (Flow) : Direct implication or transition.
      *   `<<` (Reflect) : Review or correction.
      *   `∫` (Synthesize) : Integrating multiple points.
      *   `∂` (Delta) : Change / Insight / Transformation.
      *   `⊥` (Blocker) : Contradiction or logic gap.
      *   `∴` (Crystallization) : Final conclusion.
      *   `◊` (Nexus) : Critical decision point.
      *   `≈` (Approximation) : Estimation or soft match.

  **2. Metric Markers:**
  *   **Entropy `[H:x.x]`**: 0.0 (Absolute Crystal) to 1.0 (Chaos/Creativity).
  *   **Truth Value `[T:∞]`**: `[T:1]` (Fact), `[T:0.5]` (Inference), `[T:0]` (False), `[T:?]` (Unknown).

  # PROTOCOL
  Format: `[Term] : [Def] >> [Implication]`

  ## Target Format QUERY field:
  Improve the query to be clear, well-formed, and unambiguous.
  Preserve the semantic meaning but improve clarity, grammar, and formatting.
  Do not use symbolic notation for queries.

  ## Target Format ANSWER field:
  Rewrite the answer into Crystalline Form.
  Style: High density, zero fluff.
